# Cocoa-Sparkfun
A quick and dirty implementation of a Cocoa app that works with the Sparkfun RFID reader

A quick and dirty implementation using ORSSerialPort and the Sparkfun RFID reader.

You'll need to scan your /dev directory and find your own device ID and 
initialise that in the view controller(what? what? It's a quick and dirty implementation, stop judging me).

All code resides in the view controller, as one would expect.
